This is a simple timer for speedrunning GTA San Andreas.

It automatically resets the time at the first cutscene, and starts the timer
after it, by reading game memory.

Memory addresses are hardcoded for version 1.01 and will probably have to be
changed for other versions.

The program also supports manual clock resetting and pausing by pressing
SCROLL LOCK and PAUSE keys. These keys are handled using system hotkeys when
the game isn't running, otherwise keyboard state is read from game's memory,
because hotkeys stop working for me when the game is running for some reason.


The program uses Digital-7 Mono font:
